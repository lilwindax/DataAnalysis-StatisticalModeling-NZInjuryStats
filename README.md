Injuries bring an array of both social and economic implications of injuries. For this very reason, the Ministry of Health (MOH) regards injuries as a prominent event. Current statistics by Stats NZ have shown an increase in non-fatal injuries in the period 2012-2019 (Stats NZ, 2020). As a government agency, the MOH needs to closely manage this data, to effectively manage its resources. They need to be able to analyze current trends in the data and be able to draw insight and inferences. Alongside this, they need to be able to predict using various variables to better understand what needs to be done.
